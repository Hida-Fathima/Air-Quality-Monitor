# Air-Quality-Monitor
The system aims to provide real-time monitoring of air quality parameters in indoor or outdoor environments.
The Arduino uno acts as the central hub, collecting data from the MQ135 and MQ7 sensors, which measure various air pollutants such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and carbon monoxide (CO).
The gathered data is then used for processing and analysis. 
An LCD screen is integrated into the system to provide users with immediate feedback on the air quality parameters, displaying information such as pollutant levels and corresponding visual indicators.
